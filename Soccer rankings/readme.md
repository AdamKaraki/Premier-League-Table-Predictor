##project title: PREMIER LEAGUE RANKING PREDICTIONS


#project summary: 
The goal of this project is to create a generator that analyzes a soccer team's early league performance and converts
it into a table of rankings for how the remaining games of the season will proceed. I chose to use the 2018â€“19 Premier
League season for my project and try to estimate the result based on the results of the first six game weeks. 
When we run the rankings.py file, we get the rankings along with their chances of winning the league. The Algorithm
is very effiecient and runs in less than 10 seconds.


#packages: 
I use both pandas and numpy which are standard libraries, please have them installed before running Colley.py.
Running either rankings.py and rankings_with_weights yield the same results as I was unable to create an algorithm
to consider the effects of playing home or away.
